Aroc as a tool outputs for each contract metadata for the original patch and the patch itself. 
In the folders arithmetic, reentrancy and unchecked_low_level_calls half of the folders are related to the metadata  fo the original contract and rhe other half is the patch. 

To differenciate if the folder has a .sol file is a patch, and if it contains a .json and a .ast it is metadata. 

Metadata folder could be useful for reproducibility and therefore will stay in this result folder.
