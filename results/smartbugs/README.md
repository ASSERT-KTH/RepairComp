# APR on Smartbugs-curated overview

Each contract is labeled with only one category. For more details, refer to the file _contracts.csv_

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the project is as follows:

- `Tool Name`: Directory contains the results for the execution of the tool given by the directory's name.
    + `Smartbugs-curated type`:
        - `contract_file_name.sol`*: Solidity patch generated by the respective tool.
        - `contract_file_name.bin`: Bytecode code of the patch generated by the respective tool.
        - `other`: other metadata and outputs from the tool
- `contracts.csv`: This file contains more details about each contract, including their labels.

*If the tool generates multiple patches for each contract file, then the patches naming convention is given by the tool itself. Each patch is prefixed by the `contract_file_name` and suffixed by their respective extension (`.sol` if source code, `.bin` if bytecode).
